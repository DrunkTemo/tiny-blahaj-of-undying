# Bl책haj of Undying

This is a client-side version of [Bl책haj](https://modrinth.com/mod/blahaj) by Hibi. This version replaces the totem of undying model and name instead of creating a new item for our beloved Bl책haj, who you can now cuddle even on vanilla servers!

## Content

Only the original Bl책haj exists in this version, other variants added by the original mod have not been mapped to any vanilla items.

## Why is this not a resource pack?

Because resource packs cant recreate the cuddly arms animation. That is all.
